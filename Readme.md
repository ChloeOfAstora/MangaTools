# cbz2pdf

## About
cbz2pdf is a simple utility that converts manga/comic files (cbz) to pdf format.  
Right now only jpg compression is supported which can be controlled using the -q parameter.
This program currently only works for cbz files that directly contain the images.

## Usage: 
```cbz2pdf "filename"```

## Making:
Run make, current compiler is clang++-9.


## Todo:
* Add conversion to greyscale in order to save space.
* Allow batch converting.
* Allow resizing the images.
* Add more tools.
* Please feel free to suggest more features.
